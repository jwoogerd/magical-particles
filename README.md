## Description
This is the final project for [comp175](www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/175) (graphics) by Jayme and Louis.


## References
- We had help from Mike Shah in the debugging. 
- We used the tutorial at 
[opengl-tutorial.org](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/billboards-particles/particles-instancing/) for reference on instancing and for methodology. The following files were borrowed and modified from the resources of the site: colorparticle.vert, shader.cpp, shader.h, texture.cpp, texture.hpp.


## Compilation instructions
The following graphics dependencies are necessary:

- freeglut (openGL)
- glui
- glm (math library)
- glew

Also, you need a graphics card and openGL version that supports instancing -- about half of machines have it. The binary will complain when run if it is not the right type.
